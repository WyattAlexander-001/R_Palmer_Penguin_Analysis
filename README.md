# R_Palmer_Penguin_Analysis
Using the R programming language to load in the Palmer Penguin dataset to analyze the relationship/correlation between a penguin's flipper length and body mass

# Overview

Purpose of project was to import the "Palmer Penguins" dataset, and see the correlation between body mass and flipper length. The three penguin species were: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap.

# Results

There was a positive correlation between flipper length and body mass, and the penguins with the largest body mass and flipper length are the Gentoos. The bigger the penguin, the larger the flipper mass, and this was present across all three species.

First, a scatter plot was made to see the general correlation between flipper length and body mass.

Secondly, after seeing a clear correlation between flipper length and bodymass, three separate graphs were made to highlight the differences between all the species

Lastly, to wrap up, a final graphic was made to show how they compare to one another. The conclusion was that there is a strong correlation between flipper length and bodymass, with Gentoos being the largest.
